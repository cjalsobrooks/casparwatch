fun little streamlit project, not quite done (want to make more pretty + ui stuff and just better overall) but would work for tracking purposes!

main purpose is to be a win rate tracker by map and hero... who knows why overwatch wont let us see win rate by map in game! :(

the app is built in streamlit, and uses pandas dfs for all data storage. very simple project as u can see from the code, currently about 6 hours in (starting from no streamlit knowledge)

to run, just make sure streamlit is installed and run "streamlit run casparwatch.py", the app will pop up in your browser :D
